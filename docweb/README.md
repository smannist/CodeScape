## Setup

By default, the app uses example_output.json unless an output.json file is present in the root of the docweb folder. If you want to create your own output.json, use the docgen tool.

Additionally, the build folder contains example build for the code city, this was only done for demoing. To customize it for your documentation, use the Unity building tool to generate a new build, and replace the existing build folder with your updated version.

## Running

```bash
npm install
